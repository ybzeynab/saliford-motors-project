### Employee Attrition Prediction Project
### Description and Deliverables
In this project, we delve into the analysis of a dataset to develop predictive models aimed at providing valuable insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

Business Scenario and Problem Understanding
The HR department at Salifort Motors is keen on enhancing employee satisfaction levels within the company. To kickstart this initiative, they have gathered comprehensive data from their employees.

The primary objectives of this project revolve around analyzing the dataset procured by the HR department and constructing a predictive model capable of determining whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

By accurately predicting potential employee departures, we aim to uncover underlying factors contributing to their decision to leave. This insight could subsequently empower the HR department to implement targeted strategies aimed at retention and overall employee satisfaction improvement.

### Key Deliverables:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting an in-depth exploration of the dataset to gain insights into various factors affecting employee attrition.

Feature Engineering: Crafting relevant features from the dataset to enhance the predictive power of the models.

Model Development: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms to forecast employee attrition.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the developed models through appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Insights and Recommendations: Providing actionable insights derived from the analysis and model predictions, along with recommendations for HR strategies to mitigate employee attrition.

### Repository Structure:

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation processes.

Scripts: Python scripts encapsulating reusable functions and utilities.

Results: Reports, visualizations, and model performance evaluations.

README.md: Detailed documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions for replication, and insights derived from the analysis.
